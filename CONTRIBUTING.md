## Quick start ðŸš€

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Build

- `npm run build` - build H5Web for production
- `npm run storybook:build` - build the component library's Storybook
  documentation site

## Code quality

- `npm run lint` - run all linting and code formatting commands
- `npm run lint:eslint` - lint all TS and JS files with ESLint
- `npm run lint:tsc` - type-check the whole project, test files included
- `npm run lint:prettier` - check that all files have been formatted with
  Prettier
- `npm run analyze` - inspect the size and content of the JS bundles (after
  `npm run build`)

### Automatic fixing and formatting

- `npm run lint:eslint -- --fix` - auto-fix linting issues
- `npm run lint:prettier -- --write` - format all files with Prettier

### Editor integration

Most editors support fixing and formatting files automatically on save. The
configuration for VSCode is provided out of the box, so all you need to do is
install the recommended extensions.

## Testing

- `npm test` - run unit and feature tests with Jest
- `npm run cypress` - open the
  [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress.html) end-to-end
  test runner (local dev server must be running in separate terminal)
- `npm run cypress:run` - run end-to-end tests once (local dev server must be
  running in separate terminal)
- `npm run storybook` - manually test components in isolation in
  [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction), at
  http://localhost:6006

### Visual regression

Cypress is used for end-to-end testing but also for visual regression testing.
The idea is to take a screenshot (or "snapshot") of the app in a known state and
compare it with a previously approved "reference snapshot". If any pixel has
changed, the test fails and a diff image highlighting the differences is
created.

Taking consistent screenshots across platforms is impossible because the exact
rendering of the app depends on the GPU. For this reason, visual regression
tests are run only on the CI. This is done through an environment variable
called `CYPRESS_TAKE_SNAPSHOTS`.

Visual regression tests may fail in the CI, either expectedly (e.g. when
implementing a new feature) or unexpectedly (when detecting a regression). When
this happens, the diff images and debug screenshots that Cypress generates are
uploaded as artifacts of the workflow, which can be downloaded and reviewed.

If the visual regressions are expected, the version-controlled reference
snapshots can be updated by posting a comment in the Pull Request with this
exact text: `/approve`. This triggers the _Approve snapshots_ workflow, which
runs Cypress again but this time telling it to update the reference snapshots
when it finds differences and to pass the tests. Once Cypress has updated the
reference snapshots, the workflow automatically opens a PR to merge the new
and/or updated snapshots into the working branch. After this PR is merged, the
visual regression tests in the working branch succeed and the branch can be
merged into `main`.

Here is the summarised workflow (also described with screenshots in
[PR #306](https://github.com/silx-kit/h5web/pull/306)):

1. Push your working branch and open a PR.
2. If the `e2e` job of the _Lint & Test_ CI workflow fails, check out the logs.
3. If the fail is caused by a visual regression (i.e. if a test fails on a
   `cy.matchImageSnapshot()` call), download the workflow's artifacts.
4. Review the snapshot diffs. If the visual regression is unexpected: fix the
   bug, push it and start from step 2 again. If the visual regression is
   expected: continue to step 5.
5. In the PR, post a comment with `/approve`.
6. Go to the _Actions_ page and wait for the _Approve snapshots_ workflow to
   complete.
7. Go to the newly opened PR titled _Update Cypress reference snapshots_.
8. Review the new reference snapshots once more and merge the PR.
9. Go back to your main PR and wait for the jobs of the _Lint & Test_ workflow
   to succeed.

## Deployment

- The project's `main` branch is continuously deployed to
  https://h5web.panosc.eu/ with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
- The component library's Storybook documentation site is deployed to GitHub
  Pages on every release: https://h5web-docs.panosc.eu

## NPM packages ðŸ“š

The `src/packages` folder contains entry points for the packages published to
NPM: [@h5web/lib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@h5web/lib) and
[@h5web/app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@h5web/app).

### Release process

To release a new version:

1. Check out `main` and pull the latest changes.
1. Make sure your working tree doesn't have uncommitted changes and that the
   latest commit on `main` has passed the CI.
1. Run `npm version [ patch | minor | major | <new-version> ]`

This command bumps the version number in `package.json`, commits the change and
then tags the commit with the same version number. The `postversion` script then
runs automatically and pushes the new commit and the new tag. This, in turn,
triggers the _Release_ workflow on the CI, which builds and publishes the
packages to NPM and deploys the Storybook site. The workflow is detailed in
[issue #358](https://github.com/silx-kit/h5web/issues/358).

Once the _Release_ workflow has completed:

- Make sure the new package versions are available on NPM and that the live
  Storybook site still works as expected.
- Upgrade and test the packages in apps and code sandboxes, as required.
- Write and publish [release notes](https://github.com/silx-kit/h5web/releases)
  on GitHub.

### Build and test locally

To build the packages, run the following commands:

```bash
cd packages
npm install
npm run build
```

To test a package locally, build the packages then run the following commands:

```bash
cd lib/dist
npm link
cd /your/test/app
npm link @h5web/lib
```

> If you see an "invalid hook call" error, you may need to
> [alias the `react` and `react-dom` imports](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13991#issuecomment-435587809)
> to point to your test app's `node_modules` folder.

## Icon set

H5Web uses the [Feather icon set](https://react-icons.netlify.com/#/icons/fi).
Icons can be imported as React components from `react-icons/fi`.

## Dependencies

When upgrading dependencies, take care of reading their changelogs and release
notes. Look for potential breaking changes and for bug fixes and new features
that may help improve the codebase.

Beware that some dependencies cannot be upgraded because of issues or
incompatibilities, while others must be upgraded by following a specific
process. This section documents such cases:

- `d3-array` (and therefore `@types/d3-array`) cannot be upgraded to v3.x due to
  a [bug in Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/11038).
- The major version number of `@types/node` must match the version of Node
  specified in the `engine` field of `package.json`.
- Dev dependencies related to ESLint must be upgraded together with
  `eslint-config-galex`. Their version numbers must match the ones in
  [the shared config's `package.json`](https://github.com/ljosberinn/eslint-config-galex/blob/master/package.json#L66).
  The reason for this is that `react-scripts` installs older versions of these
  dependencies, which might be used instead of the more recent versions when
  running `npm run lint:eslint`, leading to errors such as unknown linting
  rules/options. This concerns the following dev dependencies:
  - `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`
  - `@typescript-eslint/parser`
  - `eslint-plugin-import`
  - `eslint-plugin-jest`
  - `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`
  - `eslint-plugin-react`
  - `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`
  - `eslint-plugin-testing-library`
  - `eslint` (must satisfy version range of peer dependency required by
    `eslint-config-galex`)
- Some dependencies, like `@storybook/*` and `@visx/*`, still have a peer
  dependency on React < v17. When upgrading them, NPM 7 complains that the peer
  dependency's version is not satisfied. In most cases, ignoring the warning by
  forcing the installation/upgrade of the package with `--force` is fine.
  Alternatively, if this leads to a regression, you can tell NPM to install
  another version of the package that satisfies the peer dependency range with
  `--legacy-peer-deps`.
