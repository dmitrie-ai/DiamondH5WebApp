[H5Web](https://github.com/silx-kit/h5web) is a web-based viewer to explore HDF5
files. It is built with React and uses
[react-three-fiber](https://github.com/react-spring/react-three-fiber) for
visualizations.

This library exposes the root `App` component of H5Web, as well as a number of
built-in data providers.

## Getting started ðŸš€

```bash
npm install @h5web/app
```

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { App, MockProvider } from '@h5web/app';

function MyApp() {
  return (
    <MockProvider>
      <App />
    </MockProvider>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```
