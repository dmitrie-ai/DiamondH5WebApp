[H5Web](https://github.com/silx-kit/h5web) is a web-based viewer to explore HDF5
files. It is built with React and uses
[react-three-fiber](https://github.com/react-spring/react-three-fiber) for
visualizations.

This library provides data visualization components and utilities from H5Web for
use in other front-end web applications. For more information, visit the
[Storybook documentation site](https://h5web-docs.panosc.eu/).

```bash
npm install @h5web/lib
```
